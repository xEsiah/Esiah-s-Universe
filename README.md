# 🌌 Esiah's Universe — Interactive Portfolio

Welcome to the official repository of **Esiah's Universe** (formerly Esiah.dev), an interactive and experimental portfolio. This new iteration moves away from PHP to embrace a modern **React / Vite** architecture, fusing **custom WebGL** renders and immersive design to showcase my creative and technical projects.

## 🚀 Overview

Esiah's Universe is designed as a fluid and cinematic experience, blending advanced web development with art direction.
Thanks to a **Single Page Application (SPA)** architecture, navigation between sections (Home, Projects, About, Contact) occurs without page reloads, offering total immersion driven by smooth animations and complex 3D mathematics.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Infinite 3D Menu (Custom WebGL):** An interactive 3D navigation menu (sphere/disc) built with custom shaders (GLSL) and `gl-matrix`, allowing for a unique visual exploration of my projects.
- **Fluid Animations:** Powered by **GSAP** to choreograph interface transitions (such as the CardNav and Hamburger menu) with natural easing curves.
- **SPA Navigation (React Router):** Dynamic client-side routing for an instant, seamless user experience.
- **Project Showcases:** Highlighting my creations (Neo Tokyo Rush, Zatyshok, Echoes of the Last Stop, etc.) through a unified interface.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend Core:** React 18+, Vite
- **Routing:** React Router DOM
- **3D & Mathematics:** WebGL 2.0 (Custom Shaders), `gl-matrix` (quaternions, vectors, matrices)
- **Animations:** GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)
- **Deployment:** Compatible with Apache/Nginx servers (via rewrite rules for SPA routing)
